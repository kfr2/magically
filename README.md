## About Magically.US
* Author:       Kevin Richardson <kevin@magically.us>
* Magically.US was an experiment in designing a MySQL/PHP-powered jQuery Mobile application for use on smartphones.  Its goal was to provide the user a searchable, up-to-date price guide for Magic: the Gathering cards.  Furthermore, it displayed the collected price data trends through Sparkline graphs to allow the user to make informed trading, buying, or selling interactions.
